<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
    This chicken chili verde recipe is what made me appreciate the sheer power of
    the instant pot: a small number of ingredients, no pre-cooking, single pot solution,
    and a few unconventional, yet easy to find ingredients for good measure. The soup seems to
    magically appear once you release the valve and somehow turns multiple peppers into a broth
    without requireing any additional liquid. Give it a try!

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and drumsticks </li>
        <li>1 pound poblano peppers, roughly chopped, seeds and stems discarded (about 3 peppers) </li>
        <li>12 ounces tomatillos, husks discarded, quartered (about 4 tomatillos) </li>

        <li>2 Serrano or jalape√±o peppers, roughly chopped, stems discarded </li>
        <li>6 medium cloves garlic, peeled </li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
